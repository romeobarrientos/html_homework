                <p1>    Located in Scottsdale, Arizona. This restaurant charms everyone before even getting inside of the building. With two large fire displays creating a warm, welcoming entrance into
                    the building. All the food is prepared on arrival the same day as it is being served. They have a selection of Wagyu steaks that, while pricey, are worth trying once.

                <p1>This restaurant sports several locations in Arizona. However, the one in Phoenix is great. With an airy, indoor ambience as well as a great outdoor patio. 
                    The chicken is to die for at this restaurant. Also, you can not go wrong with any of the appetizers or sides. All this for a very reasonable price point!</p1>

                <p1>While this restaurant only has a few Ramen choices to choose from, each of them brings their own strengths to the table. 
                    With a huge assortment of add-ons you also have the capability to make your Ramen unique to your preferences. The price point is great here and I wish I could eat here more often!</p1>

                <p1>Famous for its purple sushi, this restaurant always tastes fresh and feels comforting. 
                    The staff is very friendly and it also doubles as a great date spot to impress anyone you know! The only pet peeve I have with this restaurant is the parking situation. 
                    But, that can be said about any restaurant located in downtown Phoenix.
